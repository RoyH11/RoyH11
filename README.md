# Hi there 👋 &nbsp;&nbsp; ![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=RoyH11&color=blue)

My name is **Roy Huang**, and I am an **AI/ML Engineer** and **Full-Stack Developer**
with a well-rounded background spanning hardware, software, data science, mathematics, and AI/ML research.

> 💼 I worked as a **Research Assistant** at the UT Southwestern Medical Center and the University of Iowa, 
focusing on developing **Deep Learning** solutions for early diagnosis of retinal diseases.

> 📜 I am **Fully Bilingual** in English and Chinese; 
this allows me to communicate with 2.4 billion people worldwide. 
I enjoy reading in both languages, and I am always looking for new books to read.

### 💻 Software Projects

- **What's in Your Fridge?** [Code](https://github.com/RoyH11/whats_in_your_fridge)
    > *A web app that helps users find recipes based on the ingredients they have at home.
    Built with Flask, React, PostgreSQL, OpenAI API, and MobileNetV2.*
    >
    > *User can upload photos of their grocery items, and the app will identify the items using MobileNetV2.
    The app will then suggest recipes based on the identified items using OpenAI API.*

- **Task Tracker** [Code](https://github.com/RoyH11/Note-Task-Manager)
    > *A web app that helps users manage their tasks and notes. 
    Built with Flask, React, and SQLAlchemy.*
    >
    > *Users can create, update, and delete tasks and notes, and filter them by status.*

- **AI Text Summarizer**
    > *A simple web app that summarizes text. 
    Built with Flask, React, and OpenAI API.*

- **Book Recommendation System** [Code](https://github.com/RoyH11/MDB_final_project)
    > *A personalized book recommendation system using collaborative filtering (Neo4j) and content-based filtering (MongoDB).
    Data: Amazon Books dataset (212k+ books, 3M+ reviews) from Kaggle.*

- **Weather Box**
    > *Senior design project: a weather station that collects and displays weather data in real-time.
    Physical device can displays information on an LCD screen, send alarms via text message, and upload data to a web app.
    Users can remotely control the device, view data, and set alarms via the web app.*
