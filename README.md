# Hi there 👋

My name is **Roy Huang**, and I am an **AI/ML Engineer** and **Full-Stack Developer**
with a well-rounded background spanning hardware, software, data science, mathematics, and AI/ML research.

> 💼 I am currently working as a **Research Assistant** at the UT Southwestern Medical Center, 
focusing on developing **Deep Learning** solutions for early diagnosis of retinal diseases.

> 📜 I am **Fully Bilingual** in English and Chinese; 
this allows me to communicate with 2.4 billion people worldwide. 
I enjoy reading in both languages, and I am always looking for new books to read.
